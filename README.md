### `Motivation`

Collectibles gain more value if they are sold as a set just like pokemon cards. Imagine a box containing all NFTâ€™s your favorite artist released.

Another use for BoXTZ is that box creators can add their messages as an NFT, which is similar to author pre-signing books or putting souvenirs along with the main order as a gesture.

Artists can benefit from BoXTZ by making the collecting process easier and faster for collectors.

Overall BoXTZ aims to provide more options for both artists and collectors for trading their NFTs.
